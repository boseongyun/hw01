## Introduction
![me](Michigan.jpg)

My name is **Boseong Yun** and please feel free to call me **Peter**! I am a first-year grdaute student studying public policy at the Harris School of Public Policy. I am studying to quantify gender inequalites in text, image, sound, and other kinds of unstructured data. Please do not hesitate to talk to me if you have any questions that I can help you with and it is really nice to meet you all! 

## Reflections

- **Github Workflow:**
This homework would have been impossible had it not been for the very instructive **video tutorial** uploaded on the course website. Specifically, it was hard to understand the dynamics of github and its versatilty with the R enviornment in forking, committing, pulling, and performing other commands. The video tutorial provided clear mapping to what and why I was actually doing by using these commands. 

- **Rmarkdown:**
I was able to experiment with  headers, emphasis, lists, images, and links mostly referring to [Rmarkdown-cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) provided by the R studio. I was able to experiment and make many changes referring to this source of information. At first, however I understood the list as a data type and I later realized that lists also meant one of the syntaxes used in Rmarkdown. Also, it was quite challenging to embed a image because I had to think about how the working repository worked on the virtual _RStudio Server platform_ in conjucntion with Github. Mostly, the difficulty came not from Rmarkdown necessarily but from integrating Rmarkdown and Github into an integrated unit. I was able to navigate my way through by trial and error where I had to erase and re-create many repositories. 

- **Final Thoughts:**
As mentioned by professor Soltoff, I think it is important to _understand_ the underlying mechanics of Github Workflow and R. This exercise turned out to be a lot more rewarding than I had intially thought specifically due to the requirement that I comprehend the workings of these two systems.
