## Introduction
![me](Michigan.jpg)

My name is **Boseong Yun** and please feel free to call me **Peter**! I am a first-year grdaute student studying public policy at the Harris School of Public Policy. I am studying to quantify gender inequalites in text, image, sound, and other kinds of unstructured data. Yes, I have a very long way to go. I have also started my own [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfv5YsyMCcQPNyT-g0cEYGA) which might be more boring than our new quarantine lives. I will try. Please do not hesitate to talk to me if you have any questions and it is really nice to meet you all!
